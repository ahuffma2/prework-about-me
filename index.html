      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Austin. I'm currently an aspiring Fullstack Developer and striving to break into the coding industry. I'm a Computer Game Developer graduate but I've since swapped my focus to Computer Science and programming. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Atlanta,GA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Gaming, Modding, Reading, Web Design, and occasionally speedrunning!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software Engineer, Web Developer, or Game Designer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's absolutely neccesary in the workforce nowadays. Being able to work a full stack is highly sought after and its the next step to my career journey! I hope to use my skills as a web dev to build my own personal projects and land that first job!</p>
